What Is a Table?

- *Relational databases* store data in tables (relations).
        - Defined by columns (with names)
        - Can have zero or more rows

- Tables represent a type of object or entity

        - Examples: employees, purchase orders, customers, sales orders

        - Consistent naming is important

- Tables act as a security boundary

- Each row represents a single instance of the entity

        - Example: one employee, one purchase order

        - Rows have no inherent order
